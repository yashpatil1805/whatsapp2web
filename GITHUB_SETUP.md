# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Your local git repository has been initialized and all files have been committed. Follow these steps to create the GitHub repository and push your code:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Repository name: `whatsapp2web`
4. Choose visibility (Public or Private)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whatsapp2web.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Alternative: If you already have a repository

If you've already created the repository, just run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whatsapp2web.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Current Status

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ All files committed (22 files, 1950+ lines)
✅ .gitignore created
✅ requirements.txt created
✅ README.md created

You're ready to push to GitHub!
